I just went to a website that has some email addresses on it. 

I need you to extract the email addresses from the attached html file and put them into a separate file.

You will need to use a couple of different things for this. You'll need to find some way to separate the email addresses from the rest of the file. 
- Look into the python regex module (import re)

Additionally, you will need to open the .html file, parse it, and then close it
Also, you'll need to create a new html file, write the extracted email addresses to the file, and then close that new file.
