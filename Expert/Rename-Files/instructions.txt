write a python script that will remove the dots from all of the file names in this directory

there are a couple of ways you could accomplish this:
- you could use the os module (import os) to read the filenames and then rename each one individually
- you could use the shutil (import shutil) module to access shell utilities
- you could use the os.system('command') to (from os import system) to call individual linux commands like this:
	os.system('ls | grep stuff') 

with reading files, you may need to give absolute path to remove ambiguity from the script
