# DC713-lets-learn-python
This project will serve as a training program for DC713 scrubs to learn python things. 

I will post problems once or twice a week (depending on how caffeinated I am) and answer the problems the following week. I will be reviewing the problems in DC713 meetings in case people have questions.  

The format for this project will evolve based on needs of the students. Initially, I will post the questions in form of a README.txt. Students, will clone the master, write a program, and return a result in the form of a file.  

Later on, questions and practice will become more complicated (like, using hashlib to decrypt a file so that you can proceed with the problem set), and will involve pulling VM from vulnhub attacking using a script and returning the results. 

Also, I encourage students to bring up complex problems so that the class may try to solve the problem together. Submit a merge request to the Students branch and I will merge these in for the class to solve. 


Follow the following format to clone the master, create a local branch, work on the code, then push the branch (not to master preferably or I'll reject it)  

1. Set up your local github configuration. Follow instructions located at (https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git) to download, install, setup and configure git on your local system.  

2. Set up your commit email address and create an HTTPS personal access token on your account (https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use#cloning-with-https-urls-recommended) 

3. Cache your Github password in Git with (https://help.github.com/en/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git)  (Alternatively, you can use SSH keys and authenticate to Github using your SSH key that you can generate using the following: https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)  

4. To clone the repo and create a new branch, follow these instructions: https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches
