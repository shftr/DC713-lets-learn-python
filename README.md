# DC713-lets-learn-python
This project will serve as a training program for DC713 scrubs to learn python things. I will post questions and problems on here occasionally and people can submit answers in the form of a git push.  I will post problems once or twice a week (depending on how caffeinated I am) and answer the problems the following week. I will be reviewing the problems in DC713 meetings in case people have questions.
